## Going to the Vet
Our project was creating a Vet simulator: a user is able to bring a pet to the vet, register the pet, view the pet record, adopt pets and more.  
For this project, we created the following classes:
[] Vet
[] VetRecord
[] Pet
[] Owner 

Each class plays a vital role in the data. We have provided thorough testing using unittests.
